# Personal_Fitness_Tracker
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become a challenge. Many individuals struggle to track their fitness progress and make informed decisions regarding their health.
The Personal Fitness Tracker using Python aims to solve this problem by providing an interactive and data-driven approach to fitness monitoring.

Objectives:
•	Developed a web-based fitness tracking application.
•	Implement machine learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to analyze fitness data.
•	Provide users with personalized insights based on their activity data.
•	Deploy the system on Streamlit Cloud for accessibility and scalability.

Methodology:
•	Frontend: Built using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface.
•	Backend: Developed in Python, integrating Scikit-Learn (sklearn) for machine learning models.
•	Machine Learning Models: Train models on user activity data to classify and predict fitness trends.
•	Deployment: Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for seamless access.

Key Results:
•	Successfully developed a fitness tracker that allows users to input their daily steps and calories burned.
•	Implemented machine learning models that analyze fitness patterns and provide personalized insights.
•	Achieved high accuracy in predicting user activity trends through trained models.
•	Created a simple, intuitive interface that enables real-time tracking and data visualization
